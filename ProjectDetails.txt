JWT
1. Store Hashed Passwords (DONEEE)
Stop storing plaintext passwords
Use BCrypt or PBKDF2
This takes 10 minutes and prevents embarrassment later

Why it matters:
It's the bare minimum protection for user data.

2. Add [Authorize] to Protected Endpoints

Log in → receive token
Only authenticated users can use APIs
Without this, token is pointless


3. Add Role-Based Authorization Where It Matters
Example:
Admin can manage users
Employee can only view their own data
You already have the role claim—use it.

4. Token Expiry
One-hour expiry is fine
No refresh token system needed unless you hate relogging

Don’t overengineer refresh tokens for personal use.


5. Basic Logout Concept

You don’t need blacklisting or token revocation tables.
Just:
Delete token from frontend storage
Done

For a project, that’s enough.
